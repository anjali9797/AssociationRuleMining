# AssociationRuleMining
Implementation of Apriori and FP Growth Algorithms and their comparison.
The main aim of the project is experimenting with the known association rule
mining algorithms and then improvising them further using the known
techniques to reduce the processing time . From this we will come to see how
different factors affect the association rule mining and when the
improvisations are effective . The algorithms that we have considered for this
project are Apriori and FP Growth. For the datasets used in this project we
referred SPMF – An open source Data Mining Library. We have used the
following five datasets majorly for this project:
• Sign Dataset
• Fifa Dataset
• Kosarak Dataset
• Bible Dataset
• Leviathian Dataset
